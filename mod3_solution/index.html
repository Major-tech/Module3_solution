        <p>
            They smell bad. They screech during test time. Inescapably loud.
Sometimes they escape and chase innocent, frightened freshmen. They will eat the garden if you let them roam around. With all the murals on the walls and people playing guitars right there in the hallways, this is a weird enough school without chickens.
I say this is a weird school because prior to this, I attended Spaulding High School in Barre — a monolith of a building surrounded by parking lots. There was no back garden to escape into. There was no greenhouse. Even with its superiority for sheer number and diversity of courses offered to Montpelier High School, Spaulding, as far as I can think of, had no science classes where you would actually go outside and look at live animals.
They’re Rhode Island Reds. Their feathers a blend of reddish-brown and gold, with bald patches since they won’t quit pecking each other. They look at you, permanently offended, with their dark round eyes. They don’t know how to walk humbly; they prance and strut. They’ll step on your feet and peck at your clothes, squawking and flapping their wings. Some of my classmates are afraid of them…well, chickens ARE the closest living relative of the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
I, however, am not. Loose threads and buttons on clothes are mistaken for food. They swarm around you because they think you’ll drop something for them to eat. They’ll fight each other sometimes, over food. But they hardly peck ME at all. When it’s time for me to collect the eggs, the hens usually move over and let me take them out of the nesting boxes. This is a good thing, since the teachers will buy the eggs after I’ve sanitized them. In turn, I give the hens the food and water that they think about every waking second. The teacher’s egg money pays me for my efforts.
I love those chickens. They’re a job, sure, but they’re also soft and fluffy and adorable. Even if I didn’t get paid I’d still visit them every day. My other not-having-gone-to-a-city-school classmates just ignore them, or throw to the hens the pieces of their lunches that they themselves don’t want to eat. I get weird looks when I come inside with hay on my shoes and carrying a bucket of eggs. They don’t get it.

        <h2 class="text-center">Beef</h2>
        <p>
            Beef is raised and/or eaten in most countries of the world. It’s price and frequency of consumption varies depending on availability. In the US it is readily available and relatively cheap; this is why we eat quite a bit. In other parts of the world like Japan it is difficult to raise due to limited space so it eaten less often and is very expensive.
During butchering each animal is divided into large “chunks” called primals. In butcher shops and some high-end restaurants you will find personnel who can butcher a whole side of beef. But in today’s supermarkets you will find people called meat cutters who do not cut beef from the side. They only break down beef from these large primal cuts into fabricated cuts that are sold at the retail level. Each primal yields specific market cuts.
As animals move about in the field they exercise their muscles, on a beef the front shoulder area gets a lot of muscle activity. The rear of the animal also gets a lot of movement, but since they walk around forward the front gets more. The most muscle development and consequently the toughest meats, happens in the front legs of the beef. The amount of fat accumulation (which is certainly related to how much activity an animal has had and the type of feed they have been given) determines the grade the animal achieves. The grade determines the price per pound of the animal. The picture shows a piece of Kobe beef with tremendous marbling.
The animals “potential” means how the animal can be butchered to yield the most desirable and expensive cuts. As stated, not every market cut can be derived form each beef. For example a butcher cannot yield a new york steaks, fillet mingons and porterhouse steaks from the same animal. Porterhouse steaks are one cut which combines the new york strip and the fillet into one. If an animal has small fillets then they can be sold more lucratively along with the new york in the porterhouse.
Prime beef is sold in high end restaurants and in quality butcher shops. It is very expensive but very tender and very flavorful. The average home cook would reserve this for a special
The U.S. beef industry is comprised of multiple, vertically connected segments. Beginning at the cow-calf level, cattle move through the industry to backgrounding/stocker operations, feedlots, and then to beef packers. The beef produced then continues to move through the marketing channel from beef packers to wholesalers and on to multiple final consumer outlets. Each level of the beef industry has both distinct and related economic issues. This dissertation contains three essays on beef cattle economics. Essay 1 focuses on price and animal health risk management at the feedlot level. Essays 2 and 3 explore how upstream demand changes impact primary beef suppliers.
The objective of Essay 1 is to determine if feedlot operators manage price risk and animal health risk as two separate and independent risks or if they manage them jointly. The animal health attribute of interest is purchasing feeder steers from a single known source versus an auction with unknown background. The output price risk mitigation tools are futures contracts, forward contracts, other, and accept cash price at time of sale. Primary data is collected using an online survey administered to feedlot operators. Participants are placed in forward looking, decision making scenarios utilizing a split-sample block design. Evidence of a relationship between animal health risk and output price risk management is mixed.
Ricardian rent theory (RRT) is tested in Essay 2 to determine if complete pass-through occurs from fed cattle and corn prices to feeder cattle prices. Monthly price data from December 1995 to December 2016 is used. Based on RRT, surplus rents should pass through the market to the holder of the scarcest resource. In cattle markets, feeder calves are the scarcest, widely traded resource and thus gains and losses at the feedlot theoretically pass-through to feeder cattle prices. The hypothesized pass-through rates suggested by RRT is calculated using monthly production data from the Focus on Feedlots data series. The regression pass-through estimates are tested against the hypothesized RRT pass-through. In many models, the estimated pass-through rate is statistically greater than the RRT hypothesized pass-through rate. Thus, when fed cattle or corn prices change, these changes are more than fully passed to cow-calf producers through the feeder cattle price. Evidence is found of asymmetric pass-through during times of herd expansion versus contraction.
Essay 3 provides a quantification of how changes in retail and export beef demand are transmitted to different members of the beef industry. Understanding how information is transmitted from primary consumer demand through the supply chain is key for long-term prosperity of the U.S. cattle industry. However, empirical applications quantifying how demand signals are transmitted through vertically connected industries are limited. Using both naïve and forward looking price expectations, a four equation system of inverse demand and supply equations for live and feeder cattle is estimated. Using retail and export beef demand indices, the impacts of 1% change in retail or export demand on live cattle and feeder cattle prices are quantified.

          <h2 class="text-center">Sushi</h2>
          <p>
            The Japanese live long, and this is already a well known fact. One of the proven secrets of longevity is that they eat fish, a lot of them. ‚·‚µ, the highlight of their fish cuisine, became very popular all over the world and had been representing Japanese food ever since. There is even a word in English: Sushi. There are numerous types of sushi such as nigiri-sushi, maki-sushi, and sashimi.
            In the 7th century, Southeast Asians introduced the technique of pickling. After 500 years, the Japanese acquired this same practice which consisted of packing fish with rice. As the fish fermented, the rice produced a lactic acid which in turn caused the pickling of the pressed fish. This was the very first form of sushi, and it was called Nare-Sushi. Then in 15th and 16th century, an altered form, Nama-Nare, appeared due to lengthy process. After a century, Matsumoto Yoshiichi of Edo introduced the use of rice vinegar into the sushi rice to add a flavor of tartness. One of the best known kinds of sushi, nigiri, wasnft introduced until 1820fs by Hanaya Yohei of Edo. His morsels, which included fresh sliced raw fish combined with the vinegared rice, were prepared and served for customers directly from his portable sushi stall. It eventually won immediate demands over the nation and descended the sushi bars of today. One of the typical nigiri sushi we eat is maguro, tuna sushi. In my experience, therefs not just one tuna sushi, but quite a few, such as an albacore tuna, a white tuna, a fatty tuna, and the regular tuna. Just like other sushi, vinegared rice and a piece of tuna are, at least, required to make a tuna sushi. Once they are ready, by taking a small portion of the rice to the middle of a hand, pressing it with fingers to make it form nicely round and fairly long, and placing a sliced tuna on top of it, maguro is made.
            Another typical sushi is maki-sushi. This sushi contains strips of fish or vegetables.
            Sushi and Sashimi have been around for quite some time now but back then it was a little different. Sushi was originally a way of preserving food; fish would be covered in rice to ferment; this kept the fish fresh for a longer period of time.. Sashimi is an art in the eyes of japanese cuisine; Sashimi is essential raw food (mainly fish), thinly sliced and served just like that. Both Sushi and Sashimi are similar but which is more traditional, more original? Sushi originated in china and was found out by random. They started to wrap raw fish in rice as a way of preserving food. Raw fish would be wrapped in rice to stay fresh, once ready to eat they would throw away the rice. This process of preserving food to be fresh spread to japan, where seafood is…show more content…
Soon after, the japanese began to eat the fish with the rice; boom sushi was born. No quite yet however. In the early 17th century they had improved the process that look long periods of time with the production of rice vinegar; this made the fermentation process  a lot shorter. People started to then eat the fish not only with the rice but now with vinegared rice; this is where modern sushi started. Sushi eventually spread into Edo (now Tokyo) and a man by the name of Matsumoto Yoshiichi was considered with “inventing” this new type of Sushi with vinegar; Sushi was prepared quicker then ever. Sushi was served differently back then
